# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis

## Overview
As an analyst I’ve conducted an initial data and exploratory analysis to uncover insights about our sales patterns. Our goal is to better understand customer behavior and identify segmentation strategies. In this README, I’ll summarize the key questions we addressed and the stakeholders’ perspectives.

## Key Questions
### Busiest Days and Hours:
We determined the busiest days of the week and peak hours for orders. This information helps schedule targeted ads during off-peak times.

### Peak Spending Times:
We explored when customers spend the most money. This informs product advertising strategies.

### Price Range Groupings:
To simplify marketing efforts, we grouped products based on price ranges.

### Popular Product Departments:
We identified which departments have the highest order frequency.

### Customer Segmentation
Brand Loyalty
We analyzed user behavior regarding brand loyalty (i.e., repeat orders).

### Loyalty Status and Ordering Habits
Differences in ordering habits based on loyalty status were explored.

### Regional Variations
We investigated regional differences in ordering behavior.

### Demographic Classifications
Demographic information (age, income, family status) suggested various customer profiles.

### Ordering Habits by Customer Profiles
We compared price of orders, order frequency, and product preferences across different customer profiles.


## Data Sources
We used open-source data sets from Instacart, including the Customers Data Set.
